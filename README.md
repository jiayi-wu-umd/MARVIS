# MARVIS: Motion & Geometry Aware Real and Virtual Image Segmentation [IROS 2024]
This work proposes a novel approach for segmentation on real and virtual image regions, exploiting synthetic images combined with domain-invariant information, a Motion Entropy Kernel, and Epipolar Geometric Consistency. Our segmentation network does not need to be re-trained if the domain changes.
